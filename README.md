# My Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal Data Science portfolio website repository. This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects, highlighting the skills and techniques I have developed over time.

## Projects

1. **Project 1: Retail Media Analysis**
   - **Description:** This project focuses on performing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail media dataset, providing insights into customer behavior, product performance, and marketing strategies.
   - **Tools and Techniques:** The project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, explore, and visualize the data.

2. **Project 2: Mexico Housing Analysis**
   - **Description:** In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Mexico based on various factors, such as location, size, and amenities.
   - **Tools and Techniques:** The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn and other relevant libraries.

3. **Project 3: Movie Recommender System**
   - **Description:** This project explores time series analysis and recommendation techniques to predict and recommend movies based on user preferences and viewing history.
   - **Tools and Techniques:** The project utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Surprise to perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development.
